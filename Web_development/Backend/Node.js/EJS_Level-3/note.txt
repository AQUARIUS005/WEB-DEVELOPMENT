EJS- Embeddded Javascript templates
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain Javascript.
It is a blueprint designed for multiple copies of the same user.
it is like instagram account page is atemplate designed for each ans=d every user using instagram.

but to send a large response we need to create an ejs file in the views folder which is basically containing html files
express when we call something to render it by default checks the views folder and returns the page template.
we can even keep another name for views folder but that is not recommended.

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.render('home.ejs');
});

Conditional statements
    <% if (dice==6) { %>
    <p>Nice roll it again</p>
    <% } %>

for loop
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <% for(let name of Followers) { %>
        <li><%= name %></li>
        <% } %>
    </ul>
