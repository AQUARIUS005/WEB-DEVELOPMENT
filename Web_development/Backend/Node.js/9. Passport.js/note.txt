---- Authentication and Authorization ----
Authentcation is the process of verifying who we are
Authorization is the process of verfying which resources a user has access to

------Storing Passwords------
We never store passwords as it is. We store their hashed form
Hashing function modifies the password into a clumsy string which cannot be identified easily

--note about hashing function
for every input there is a fixed output.
They are one way functions, we can't get input from output.
different inputs bring different output, but of same length.
small changes in input brings large changes in output.

-----Salting-----
Salting is a technique to protect passwords stored in databases by adding a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them.

express compatible middleware authentication for node.js
a npm package or library used for Authentcation and has several models for authentication purposes like facebook, google, linkedin, github etc.
 in WanderLust we are using 
 passport
