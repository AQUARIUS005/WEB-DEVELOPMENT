Managing and Making a Project Available in GitHub:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a Repo on GitHub: Name it and copy the URL.
Set Up Locally:
Create or use an existing project folder.
Run git init to initialize Git.
Add files (git add .) and commit (git commit -m "Initial commit").
Connect to GitHub:
Link the repo: git remote add origin <repository_url>.
Push it: git push -u origin main.
Check GitHub: Refresh to see your files online.


Creating and Managing Saved Points in Git:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stage Changes: Use "git add <file>" or git add . to prepare files.
Commit Changes: Save with "git commit -m "message"".
View History: Check commits using "git log".
Revert if Needed: Undo uncommitted changes with "git restore <file>" or revisit previous commits with "git checkout <hash>".

The git checkout <hash> command in Git allows you to view a specific past version of your project by switching to that commit's state. 
However, this puts you in a "detached HEAD" state, meaning any changes you make won't be associated with a branch and could be lost.

To safely work with a past commit, create a new branch from it using git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <hash>. 
This ensures your changes are tracked and allows you to easily merge or discard them later.

To return to the main branch:
If you have no uncommitted changes: git checkout main
If you have uncommitted changes:
git stash to save them temporarily.
git checkout main.
git stash pop to restore the changes.
Note: git reset --hard HEAD can also switch you back to the last commit, but it discards all uncommitted changes, so use it with caution.

Exploring Git Reset Options:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soft Reset: Move HEAD to a previous commit but keep changes staged:
git reset --soft <commit_hash>
Mixed Reset: Move HEAD, unstage changes but keep them locally:
git reset --mixed <commit_hash>
Hard Reset: Completely reset HEAD and delete changes:
git reset --hard <commit_hash>


Understanding Git and GitHub Workflow:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clone: Copy a GitHub repo to your local machine:
git clone <repository_url>
Make Changes: Modify files locally.
Add and Commit: Stage and commit changes:
git add . 
git commit -m "message"
Push: Upload changes to GitHub:
git push origin main
Pull: Update your local repo with changes from GitHub:
git pull origin main
Branching: Work on new features or fixes in separate branches:
git checkout -b feature-branch


Understanding Git Permissions and Folder Recognition:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Permissions: Git tracks file permission changes (e.g., making a file executable), but not regular changes unless the file is executable.
    chmod +x script.sh
    git commit -m "Make script executable"
Folder Recognition: Git doesn’t track empty folders. Use a placeholder file like .gitkeep to track empty folders.
Remote Permissions: Permissions for executable files are preserved when pushed to remote repos like GitHub.


Understanding Git Concepts and Commands:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git Basics: Git tracks file changes and maintains project history.
Common Commands:
--------------------------
git init: Initialize a repo.
git status: Check changes.
git add <file>: Stage files.
git commit -m "message": Save changes.
git push: Upload changes to remote.
git pull: Fetch changes from remote.
git log: View commit history.


Understanding Git Status and File Tracking:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git status: Shows the state of files in your project (untracked, modified, staged).
File Tracking:
Untracked: New files Git isn’t tracking.
Modified: Changed files not staged.
Staged: Files ready for commit.


Understanding the Concept of Commit and Checking File Status:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commit: A commit records a snapshot of changes, with a unique ID and message.
git status: Check which files are modified, staged, or untracked before committing.
Committing: Stage files with git add and commit with git commit -m "message".
Commit Message: Be clear and descriptive about the changes made.

Understanding Branching in Git:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branch: A separate line of development for features or fixes.
Create a Branch:
git branch <branch_name>
Shift to that branch or use that branch:
git checkout <branch_name>
List Branches:
git branch
Merge Branches: Bring changes from a branch into the main branch:
git checkout main
git merge <branch_name>


Understanding Branching and Merging in Git:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branching: Create branches for features or fixes:
git checkout -b <branch_name>
Merging: Merge a branch into main to integrate changes:
git checkout main //shift to main
git merge <branch_name> //now merge the branch to main
Fast-Forward Merge: If no changes in main, Git simply moves the pointer.
Three-Way Merge: If changes exist in both branches, Git combines them into a new commit.
Merge Conflicts: Resolve conflicting changes manually, then commit.


Learning About Code Merging and Branching:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branching and Merging: Work on separate branches for features/bug fixes, then merge them into the main branch once complete.
Collaborative Workflow: Multiple developers can work on different branches and merge their work into the main branch.
Merge Conflicts: Manually resolve conflicts if Git cannot automatically merge changes.


Handling Conflicts While Merging Code:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merge Conflict: Occurs when two branches modify the same part of a file, such as a function, and Git cannot automatically decide which change to keep.
Identifying Conflicts: Git marks conflicts in the file with <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>.
Resolving Conflicts: Manually edit the file to decide which changes to keep, then remove the conflict markers.
Finalizing Merge: Stage the resolved files with git add and commit the merge.


Features in Git Branches Explained:
-------------------------------------------------------
Branches: Separate lines of development for features or fixes.
Branch Isolation: Each branch works as an isolated environment for different tasks.
Switching Branches: Use git checkout <branch_name> to switch branches.
Creating/Deleting Branches:
Create: git branch <branch_name>
Delete: git branch -d <branch_name>
Merging and Conflicts: When merging, resolve conflicts manually if needed.
Remote Branches: Push local branches to remote repositories with git push.


Navigating Between Branches and Managing Changes:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Switching Branches: Use git checkout <branch_name> to switch between branches.
Making Changes: Work on separate features in different branches without affecting others.
Checking Out Remote Branches: Use git fetch and git checkout <branch_name> to access remote branches.
Uncommitted Changes: If you have uncommitted changes and need to switch branches, use git stash to temporarily save changes without committing. 
This prevents conflicts and allows you to safely switch branches. Later, you can retrieve the changes with git stash apply.
Merging Changes: Use git merge <branch_name> to merge changes from other branches.
Reason to Stash:
-----------------
Stash is useful when you have uncommitted changes in a branch but need to switch to another branch (e.g., to pull or fix something). 
Stashing temporarily stores the changes so you can switch branches without losing your work, and then you can apply them back once you're ready.
